# Lightweight React Template for KAVIA

This project provides a minimal React template with a clean, modern UI and minimal dependencies.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: No heavy UI frameworks - uses only vanilla CSS and React
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with KAVIA brand styling
- **Fast**: Minimal dependencies for quick loading times
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and modify

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Integration:
- Create a .env file based on .env.example and set REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL to your backend (default http://localhost:3001).
- Ensure your backend CORS allow_origins includes your frontend origin (default http://localhost:3000). Do not use wildcard in production.
- Do not set Content-Type manually for file uploads on the frontend; the browser will set multipart/form-data with proper boundary.
- Backend should return application/json for API responses; the client gracefully falls back to text if needed.
- Verify endpoints:
  - POST /evaluations (multipart/form-data: file, title, notes)
  - GET /evaluations/{id}
- OpenAPI at: http://localhost:3001/docs (or the base URL you configured)

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Customization

### Colors

The main brand colors are defined as CSS variables in `src/App.css`:

```css
:root {
  --kavia-orange: #E87A41;
  --kavia-dark: #1A1A1A;
  --text-color: #ffffff;
  --text-secondary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);
  --border-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
}
```

### Components

This template uses pure HTML/CSS components instead of a UI framework. You can find component styles in `src/App.css`. 

Common components include:
- Buttons (`.btn`, `.btn-large`)
- Container (`.container`)
- Navigation (`.navbar`)
- Typography (`.title`, `.subtitle`, `.description`)
